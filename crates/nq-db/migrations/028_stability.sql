-- Migration 028: Stability axis — presence pattern classification.
--
-- Adds a stability column to warning_state for classifying the finding's
-- presence pattern: new, stable, flickering, or recovering.
-- Computed per-finding from consecutive_gens and observation history.
-- Orthogonal to diagnosis and severity.
--
-- See docs/gaps/STABILITY_AXIS_GAP.md.

ALTER TABLE warning_state ADD COLUMN stability TEXT;

-- Recreate v_warnings to expose stability
